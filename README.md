# Workout-Tracker 
In this project, I built a workout tracker where users can type in a sentence describing the workout(s) they did and its duration. (Ex:I jogged for 2 hours and did squats for 1 hour). This input will then be automatically used to create row(s) in a spreadsheet where each row is a workout. Additionally, the number of calories used will also be generated and listed as one of the values of the row. The nutritionix api was used to calculate the number of calories used depending on the workout(s) completed. The sheety api was used to create the spreadsheet to which each user entry can be posted to. The link to the spreadsheet is below.  This project was created as part of a Udemy Course- 100 Days of Code:The Complete Python Bootcamp for 2022.
